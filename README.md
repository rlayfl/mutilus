# mutilus

A web applicaiton designed to gather data on recognition of marker buoys.

Richard Lay-Flurrie

## The Project

This project is designed to collect data on the ability of people to recognise marker buoys in various conditions. 

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to determine whether people find it easier to recognise marker buoys in real photographs or from images generated in Unreal Engine 5.

## Methodology

Volunteers will take part in the experiment by interacting with a web application. The web application will show the volunteers pictures of marker buoys and the volunteer will have to identify the marker buoy.

Their answers will be logged and saved for analysis.

## The Story

You are a police officer, part of the marine unit of Essex Police. You have received an urgent call that a container ship bound for Harwich has lost all control of its propeller system but has limited control over its rudder system. Due to the weight on board, the ship cannot be stopped for at least 5 miles, so the ship's survival depends entirely on your ability to inform them of potential hazards in the water, allowing them to quickly plot a course to safety.

You must rapidly remind yourself of each type of marker buoy. You will then be sent photographs of marker buoys and will need to quickly identify each one, allowing enough time for the ship's navigator to plot a course.
