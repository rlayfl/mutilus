## The Project

This project is designed to collect data on the ability of people to recognise marker buoys in various conditions. 

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to determine whether people find it easier to recognise marker buoys in real photographs or from images generated in Unreal Engine 5.

## Methodology

Volunteers will take part in the experiment by interacting with a web application. The web application will show the volunteers pictures of marker buoys and the volunteer will have to identify the marker buoy.

Their answers will be logged and saved for analysis.
